      "ExplanationHeader": "Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is an inherited, autosomal dominant syndrome manifested by a variety of benign and malignant tumors. A VHL gene abnormality diagnostic for VHL syndrome is present in approximately 1 in 36,000 individuals. The initial manifestations of disease can occur in childhood, adolescence, or adulthood, with a mean age at initial presentation of approximately 26 years. The spectrum of VHL-associated tumors includes <strong>pheochromocytomas</strong>, clear cell renal cell carcinomas (RCCs), hemangioblastomas of the brain (cerebellum) and spine, retinal capillary hemangioblastomas (retinal angiomas), endolymphatic sac tumors of the middle ear, serous cystadenomas and neuroendocrine tumors of the pancreas, and papillary cystadenomas of the epididymis and broad ligament.<br /><br />Morbidity and mortality in patients with VHL disease have decreased substantially due to an improved understanding of the natural history of the serious clinical manifestations of the disorder, better imaging techniques, and improvements in therapy. Surveillance is important not only to detect new lesions at an early stage but also to monitor small asymptomatic lesions for evidence of progression. Pheochromocytoma is an important association with VHL patients. It most commonly occurs in patients who are between 12-25 years of age. RCC most commonly occurs later between 25-50 years of age.<br /><br />For individuals with VHL who are 10 years of age or older, the surveillance protocol is as follows:<br /><br />\n<table border=\"2\" frame=\"box\" rules=\"all\" cellspacing=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\" colspan=\"2\"><strong>VHL Surveillance Protocol</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Annually</strong></td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Every 2 Years</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<ul>\n<li>Eye/retinal examination with indirect ophthalmoscopy using a dilated examination by an ophthalmologist informed about VHL disease</li>\n<li>Quality ultrasound and MRI scan of the abdomen with and without contrast to assess the kidneys, pancreas, and adrenals at least yearly but not during pregnancy</li>\n<li>Physical examination by a clinician informed about VHL disease</li>\n<li>Test for plasma metanephrines or urinary metanephrines using a 24-hour urine test</li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n<td>\n<ul>\n<li>MRI with contrast of brain, cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine with thin cuts through the posterior fossa, and attention to inner ear/petrous temporal bone to rule out both&nbsp;endolymphatic sac tumor&nbsp;and hemangioblastomas</li>\n<li>Audiology assessment by an audiologist</li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>"

It is most commonly seen in patients with <strong>autoimmune</strong> conditions who usually are on chronic steroids, which suppress the adrenal glands. Hyponatremia in adrenal insufficiency is caused by the lack of aldosterone and the release of excess antidiuretic hormone (ADH). Aldosterone's function is to increase sodium reabsorption and potassium excretion in the kidney. The hypotension seen in adrenal insufficiency stimulates the release of ADH, which in turn causes free water absorption and further worsens the hyponatremia.<br /><br />Patients with suspected acute adrenal insufficiency (such as this patient with refractory hypotension requiring 2 vasopressors despite appropriate resuscitation and antibiotics) should be empirically supplemented with IV glucocorticoids (eg, hydrocortisone, dexamethasone).

      "ExplanationHeader": "Hemangiomas are rare benign tumors that present along the length of the small bowel and mostly present as gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. They mostly present with occult GI bleeding and iron deficiency anemia. Because of their rarity, hemangiomas are not considered a common cause of GI bleeding.&nbsp;The only reason for operative management of a&nbsp;benign small bowel lesion is to control symptoms. Mass effect causing intussusception or obstruction, hemorrhage, or a suspicion of malignancy generates the need for local resection of the lesion. The diagnostic dilemma is&nbsp;the most common reason for resection of an incidentally found mass on contrast study or endoscopy. <br /><br />Although the hemangiomas may be present along the entire length of the small bowel, endoscopy can be therapeutic for proximal or distal lesions as there is a lot of small bowel that endoscopy can't reach. Most of the jejunal and some ileal lesions can be managed successfully with endoscopic intervention alone. Thus, endoscopic management is a viable therapeutic option.<br /><br />Hemangiomatous lesions can be resected or managed with angiographic embolization. According to a recent review of literature,&nbsp;91.9% of the lesions were diagnosed preoperatively by capsule endoscopy and/or balloon-assisted endoscopy, and 45.9% of them were treated endoscopically.<br /><br /><br /><img src=\"https://d2vrujxrqm3l5p.cloudfront.net/29204058-01ec-431b-8e43-01863e29b5b0.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"438\" height=\"327\" /><br />Laparoscopic view of the jejunal hemangioma.&nbsp;(Image from&nbsp;Jones AE, Ainsworth BH, Desai A, Tsang TT.

Because of the anatomic variability of the hepatocystic triangle, it is important to obtain the critical view of safety before clipping or dividing structures in this area.<br /><br />Intraoperatively, the classic laparoscopic injury involves the misidentification of the common duct for the cystic duct. This injury occurs from excessive cephalad retraction of the gallbladder fundus, insufficient lateral retraction on the infundibulum, or both&mdash;the common bile duct is then mistaken for the cystic duct, with subsequent ligation and transection.&nbsp;<br /><br />Biliary injuries can occur in combination with vascular injuries.

Hospitalized children are at higher risk of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone release, which can lead to hyponatremia. Hypotonic fluid resuscitation can exacerbate this process.<br /><br />The easiest way to determine the rate for maintenance fluids is the classic \"4-2-1 rule\": 4 mL/hr for the first 10 kg of body weight; 2 mL/hr for each kg of body weight from 11&ndash;20 kg; 1 mL/hr for each additional kg of body weight over 20 kg.

Damage to DNA is induced by direct ionization or from oxygen free radicals that are formed by the ionization of water surrounding the DNA. DNA strands that break and that are unrepaired result in cell death. In the absence of oxygen, DNA damage is more readily repairable. This is because oxygen can interact with the broken ends of DNA, creating organic peroxides that are not easily repaired by the cell. Additionally, oxygen prolongs the life span of highly reactive free radicals. Well-oxygenated cells are up to 3 times more radiosensitive than hypoxic cells. Intratumor hypoxia may be chronic when the tumor outgrows the limits of its blood supply, or acute resulting from a disruption of microregional blood flow.&nbsp;<br /><br />\n<table border=\"2\" frame=\"box\" rules=\"all\" cellspacing=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Factors Associated With Radiation Resistance</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Hypoxia</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Smoking status</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Inherent tumor cell characteristics</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Repopulation</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Tumor location</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Tumor grade</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<br /><img src=\"https://d2vrujxrqm3l5p.cloudfront.net/c6fab0f3-0ea7-4f04-a71a-12ee43618759.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"795\" height=\"398\" /><br />OER: Oxygen enhancement ratio<br />D<sub>hypox</sub>: Dose in hypoxia<br />D<sub>normox</sub>: Dose in normal oxygen tension<br />ROS:&nbsp;Reactive oxygen species"

Immediately after entering the abdomen, laparotomy pads should be placed for temporary hemorrhage control, allowing anesthesia to catch up with resuscitative efforts. Packs should not be placed directly into the liver laceration, as this may potentially worsen the situation.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Other techniques include the Pringle maneuver, which occludes the inflow to the liver via manual clamping of the hepatoduodenal ligament and, therefore, occlusion of the portal vein and proper hepatic artery. This should be done in an atraumatic fashion, either with fingers, atraumatic vascular clamps, Rummel tourniquet, or a Penrose drain. If bleeding decreases after this maneuver, bleeding is likely from a branch of the hepatic artery or portal vein. If brisk bleeding continues despite this effort, the source of bleeding is likely from the hepatic veins, which are posterior to the liver and empty into the inferior vena cava (IVC).&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />While the Pringle maneuver is being performed, exploration of the laceration can take place with ligation of bleeding vessels and cauterization of the parenchyma. Individual hepatic vessels may be visualized by finger fracture of the liver tissue. The points of bleeding can then be controlled with electrocautery, stapling of liver tissue, individual suture ligatures, placement of omentum into the laceration, etc. The Pringle maneuver should only be performed for 15&ndash;20 minutes at a time, followed by a period of unclamping for 5 minutes to prevent liver ischemia and potential abscess formation.&nbsp;Prolonged clamp time, as in this patient, can lead to <strong>liver ischemia</strong>, <strong>tissue necrosis</strong>, and possible <strong>abscess formation</strong>.

The most likely source of re-epithelialization of the donor site of an STSG is from <strong>multipotent stem cells that primarily reside in hair follicles</strong>.&nbsp;<br /><br />STSGs are grafts involving the epidermis and any part of the dermis and range in thickness from 0.005-0.030 inches. Depending on the amount of dermis included, they are classified as thin (0.005-0.012 inches), medium (0.012-0.018 inches), or thick (0.018-0.030 inches). In contrast, a full-thickness skin graft (FTSG) is composed of the epidermis and the entire dermis.&nbsp;<br /><br /> The size of the graft needed is an important consideration, with regard to donor site morbidity. An STSG donor site heals by secondary intention with minimal morbidity; however, the donor site of an FTSG necessitates primary closure to mitigate donor site morbidity. Dressings over STSG donor sites that promote a moist environment until&nbsp;re-epithelialization (at least 7 days) are most optimal. Common donor-site dressings include semipermeable films, gauze dressing (Adaptic), alginate,&nbsp;hydrocolloid, or&nbsp;silicone dressing. Meticulous care of the donor site is important since the regenerated skin from the donor site may need to be re-harvested. Studies have shown that time to complete&nbsp;re-epithelialization is shorter with hydrocolloid dressings than with any other dressing, while gauze dressings had the highest infection rates.<br /><br />\n<table border=\"2\" frame=\"box\" rules=\"all\" cellspacing=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Split-thickness Skin Graft&nbsp;Donor Site Dressing Characteristics</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Encourages rapid re-epithelialization</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Minimizes pain</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Decreases risk of infection</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Minimizes scarring</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>"

It is recommended any patient over age 60 with an open book pelvic fracture undergo a pelvic angiogram with possible embolization per Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma (EAST) guidelines. <br /><br />The combination of age &gt; 60 and major pelvic fracture is highly associated with the need for angiography with embolization (odds ratio, 15) regardless of the patient's hemodynamic status. Indeed, 62% of patients older than 60 years requiring angiographic embolization had normal vital signs on hospital admission. <br /><br />An open book fracture involves disruption of the pelvic ring at two or more locations resulting in dissociation of the right and left hemipelvis.

Other pelvic organs at risk of injury following pelvic trauma include the bladder, urethra, and rectum. Diagnosis is typically made through a combination of physical exam and imaging including x-ray and CT scan. An open book pelvic fracture produces bleeding because of continued injury to small vessels secondary to pelvic instability and the increased volume of the pelvis."

      "BottomLine": "Tension pneumothorax is a potentially life-threatening condition characterized by jugular venous distention, tracheal deviation contralateral to&nbsp;the side of injury, and absent/decreased ipsilateral breath sounds.&nbsp;The management is immediate decompression via needle or thoracostomy at the fifth intercostal space and midaxillary line without waiting for further diagnostic tests.",
      "ExplanationHeader": "This patient most likely has&nbsp;<strong>tension pneumothorax</strong>&nbsp;due to blunt trauma from the impact of the steering wheel or airbag. Without waiting for further diagnostic studies (x-ray, eFAST, CT scan), the most appropriate next step is an immediate tube<strong> thoracostomy</strong> <strong>at the right fifth intercostal space at the midaxillary line.</strong>&nbsp;<br /><br />Tension pneumothorax results from an air leak from the lung into the chest wall, causing air to be pushed into the pleural space without a means of escape. The lung eventually collapses due to the buildup of air, putting tension on other organs in the mediastinum.&nbsp;As a result, the mediastinum is displaced to the opposite side of the injury (in this patient's case, to the left side) and causes tracheal deviation. The marked decrease of venous return due to this sift and compression can result in cardiogenic shock.<br /><br />Once the diagnosis of tension pneumothorax is made, immediate treatment is indicated. Management options include needle decompression or finger thoracostomy followed by a chest tube. Either procedure is to be performed at approximately the fifth intercostal space at the midaxillary line. Historical management algorithms advocated apical needle decompression at the midclavicular line, but this is no longer recommended due to high rates of malpositioning. <br /><br />Tension pneumothorax as it appears on x-ray is shown in the figure below.<br /><br />\n<table border=\"2\" frame=\"box\" rules=\"all\" cellspacing=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Characteristic Signs and Symptoms of a Tension Pneumothorax</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<ul>\n<li>Chest pain</li>\n<li>Air hunger</li>\n<li>Tachypnea</li>\n<li>Respiratory distress</li>\n<li>Tachycardia</li>\n<li>Hypotension</li>\n<li>Tracheal deviation&nbsp;away&nbsp;from the side of the injury</li>\n<li>Ipsilateral absence of breath sounds</li>\n<li>Elevated hemithorax without respiratory movement</li>\n<li>Jugular venous distention</li>\n<li>Cyanosis (late finding)</li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<br /> <img style=\"display: block;\" src=\"https://d2vrujxrqm3l5p.cloudfront.net/8a4c42eb-4d94-4c95-ba84-2816d1a30b5a.png\" alt=\"Right sided tension pneumothorax \" width=\"500\" height=\"400\" />Right-sided pneumothorax seen on an anteroposterior chest x-ray.

      "ExplanationHeader": "Malignant hyperthermia is a rare life-threatening condition that is usually triggered by exposure to certain drugs used for general anesthesia&mdash;specifically the volatile anesthetic agents and succinylcholine, a neuromuscular blocking agent. In susceptible individuals, these drugs can induce a drastic and uncontrolled increase in oxidative metabolism in skeletal muscle, which overwhelms the body's capacity to supply oxygen, remove carbon dioxide, and regulate body temperature, eventually leading to circulatory collapse and death if not immediately treated.<br /><br />The current treatment of choice is the IV administration of dantrolene, the only known antidote, discontinuation of triggering agents, and supportive therapy directed at correcting hyperthermia, acidosis, and organ dysfunction. Treatment must be instituted rapidly on clinical suspicion of the onset of malignant hyperthermia. Hyperthermia is corrected with cooling blankets, acetaminophen, and ice packs. Acidosis, as in this case, is corrected by the administration of bicarbonate. <br /><br />Dantrolene is a muscle relaxant that appears to work directly on the ryanodine receptor to prevent the release of calcium. After the widespread introduction of treatment with dantrolene, the mortality of malignant hyperthermia fell from 80% in the 1960s to less than 5%."

It is also useful in evaluating nonvariceal sources of bleeding. Early evaluation is critical in many cases because uncontrolled variceal bleeding can lead to catastrophic hemodynamic collapse.

Sometimes, 2 or 3 endoscopic interventions are needed within 24 hours.<br /><br /> Approximately&nbsp;70% of patients with esophageal varices will have another bleed within 2 months. Even in the post acute setting, if nonbleeding varices are visualized, they should be banded. The patient should also be placed on proton pump inhibitors and/or sucralfate therapy.

      "BottomLine": "In patients with suspected distal cholangiocarcinomas, endoscopic ultrasound and/or ERCP are preferred for tissue diagnosis because they permit direct visualization of the area of abnormality, enable a biopsy (either fine-needle aspiration or brush cytology) and, in the case of ERCP, allow for therapeutic intervention (eg, biliary decompression with stent placement).",
      "ExplanationHeader": "Cholangiocarcinomas (bile duct cancers), which&nbsp;account for approximately 3% of all GI malignancies,&nbsp;arise from the epithelial cells of the intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts. Although these cancers are rare in the United States, they are highly lethal because most are locally advanced or metastatic at presentation.&nbsp;<br /><br />This patient&rsquo;s presentation of a focal bile duct stricture with no history of biliary surgery and no choledocholithiasis in the context of his severe obstructive jaundice is cholangiocarcinoma until proven otherwise. In good surgical candidates with clinical and imaging characteristics consistent with cholangiocarcinoma, complete staging and operative exploration should proceed even in the absence of a definitive tissue diagnosis.&nbsp;<br /><br />If a patient is suspected of having cholangiocarcinoma but has not undergone imaging, the initial imaging test is typically a contrast-enhanced MRI/MRCP or a multiphasic contrast-enhanced CT scan. Because adequate imaging of the abdomen has been performed in this patient with evidence of distal extrahepatic obstruction, the next step is to obtain a tissue diagnosis if feasible, although some argue that going straight to surgical resection without a tissue diagnosis is appropriate if imaging and clinical presentation is consistent with a cholangiocarcinoma.&nbsp;<br /><br />For suspected<strong> distal cholangiocarcinomas</strong>, tissue diagnosis can be obtained via&nbsp;endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-guided fine-needle aspiration (FNA) or <strong>ERCP with brushings for cytology</strong>. This patient is symptomatic from his jaundice; therefore, he will also require <strong>biliary decompression&nbsp;via stent placement</strong>. Many providers start with an EUS unless the patient requires endoscopic biliary drainage or the lesion is not amenable to EUS-guided FNA because of its location.<br /><br /><img src=\"https://d2vrujxrqm3l5p.cloudfront.net/2ff07a77-b335-4b17-b1cf-0e7286552f71.png\" alt=\"\" /><br />T2-weighted axial MRI showing mild wall thickness in the distal common bile duct (white arrow), indicative of distal cholangiocarcinoma."

        "Explanation": "Attempts at endoscopic trichobezoar removal have been reported in the literature; however, the success rate is minimal. In addition, repeated attempts at passing the scope to remove the fragments of the bezoar are associated with a high risk of esophageal injury. Finally, there is a risk of fragments migrating beyond the stomach which can increase the risk of subsequent surgical intervention. It is important to note that endoscopy remains highly valuable as a diagnostic tool for trichobezoars. While an esophagogastroduodenoscopy for diagnosis and visualization would have been the correct answer, endoscopic removal is not. Small trichobezoars may respond to endoscopic fragmentation however the stem mentions upper GI showing a filling defect taking the contour of the stomach which will not be amenable to endoscopic removal.",

Parathyroid hormone increases calcium and phosphate absorption from the gut, calcium reabsorption in the kidney, and calcium and phosphate release through increased osteoclast activity in bone. Primary hyperparathyroidism patients often have hypophosphatemia and a mild hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis because PTH blocks phosphate and bicarbonate absorption in the proximal tubules. <br /><br />Twenty-four&ndash;hour urine calcium is typically either normal or elevated in patients with PHPT because the kidneys still manage to secrete some of the excess serum calcium.

      "BottomLine": "Ampicillin-sulbactam is the only monotherapy regimen approved for the parenteral treatment of ampicillin-susceptible enterococci infections.&nbsp;&nbsp;Linezolid and daptomycin are approved for the treatment of ampicillin-resistant&nbsp;<em>E. faecium</em>.",
      "ExplanationHeader": "Enterococcal isolates are usually tested for susceptibility to ampicillin, penicillin, and vancomycin. The presence of beta-lactamase is very rare; it confers resistance to penicillin and ampicillin when large numbers of organisms are present (such as in the setting of a valvular vegetation), even though the organism may test susceptible using standard laboratory inocula. Thus, to rule out this possibility in patients with life-threatening enterococcal infection (such as meningitis or endocarditis), some experts recommend that the isolate be screened for beta-lactamase production with nitrocefin, a chromogenic cephalosporin, even if ampicillin susceptible.<br /><br />The optimal approach for treatment of <strong>enterococcal infection</strong> due to vancomycin-resistant <em>Enterococcus faecium</em> is uncertain. One agent, linezolid, is US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for treatment of infections caused by vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE; previous approval of quinupristin-dalfopristin has been removed). The utility of this agent for treatment of endocarditis is uncertain, although there are anecdotal cases suggesting some utility. The resistance profile of VRE isolates should be evaluated carefully in conjunction with infectious diseases expertise when selecting appropriate therapy for such organisms. The approach to treatment of such isolates should be assessed in each individual case.<br /><br /><strong>Vancomycin-resistant <em>E. faecium</em> isolates</strong> often have concurrent high-level resistance to beta-lactams and aminoglycosides. In contrast, <strong>vancomycin-resistant <em>E. faecalis</em>&nbsp;isolates</strong> are usually susceptible to beta-lactams, as are <em>E. gallinarum</em> and <em>E. casseliflavus</em> (which are intrinsically vancomycin resistant). The newer agents linezolid, daptomycin, and tigecycline have activity against both vancomycin-resistant <em>E. faecalis</em> and <em>E. faecium</em>, whereas quinupristin-dalfopristin has activity against <em>E. faecium</em> but not <em>E. faecalis</em>."

      "BottomLine": "The main complication of pancreatic necrosis is infection. The risk is directly related to the amount of necrosis.",
      "ExplanationHeader": "Pancreatic necrosis is the presence of nonviable pancreatic parenchyma or peripancreatic fat; it can be manifested as a focal area or diffuse involvement of the gland. Contrast-enhanced CT is the most reliable technique to diagnose pancreatic necrosis. It is typically seen as areas of low attenuation (&lt; 40 to 50 HU) after the IV injection of contrast material. Normal parenchyma usually has a density of 100 to 150 HU. Up to 20% of patients with AP develop pancreatic necrosis. It is important to identify and to provide proper treatment of this complication because most patients who develop multiorgan failure have necrotizing pancreatitis; pancreatic necrosis has been documented in up to 80% of the autopsies of patients who died after an episode of AP.<br /><br />The main complication of pancreatic necrosis is infection. The risk is directly related to the amount of necrosis; in patients with pancreatic necrosis involving less than 30% of the gland, the risk of infection is 22%. The risk is 37% for patients with pancreatic necrosis that involves 30% to 50% of the gland and up to 46% if more than 70% of the gland is affected. This complication is associated with bacterial translocation usually involving enteric flora, such as gram-negative rods (e.g., Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, and Pseudomonas spp.) and Enterococcus spp.\n<p><br />Infected pancreatic necrosis should be suspected in patients with prolonged fever, elevated white blood cell count, or progressive clinical deterioration. Evidence of air within the pancreatic necrosis seen on a CT scan confirms the diagnosis but is a rare finding. If infected necrosis is suspected, fine-needle aspiration (FNA) may be performed if the diagnosis is equivocal; from the aspirate, a positive Gram stain or culture establishes the diagnosis. Although positive cultures are confirmatory, a review has demonstrated that despite negative preoperative cultures, 42% of patients with so-called persistent unwellness will have infected necrosis.</p>\n<p><br />Currently, an endoscopic drainage with a large-bore stent and possible endoscopic d&eacute;bridement with or without percutaneous drainage may avoid open operations in some patients. If the endoscopic management fails, an open operation will usually be more straightforward and the results improved. When either route is taken, physiologic and nutritional support of the patient will have a large impact on outcome."

The chemotherapy regimen typically involves a platinum-based regimen (ie, cisplatin and etoposide) coupled with 45 Gy of radiation therapy. Resection should involve a lobectomy and all involved structures.

If the occlusion is at the level of the iliac bifurcation, the buttock and upper thigh may be spared due to collateral circulation from the internal iliac artery but a loss of the femoral artery pulse is expected. If the occlusion is at the level of the femoral bifurcation, the thigh should be spared as the profunda is patent.

      "BottomLine": "Endoscopic mucosal resection is the preferred method of resection for Tis (limited to the epithelium) and T1a (has not penetrated through the muscularis mucosa into the submucosa).",
      "ExplanationHeader": "The wall of the esophagus tract has 4 main layers. The mucosa is the first layer of bowel wall and consists of epithelium, basement membrane, lamina propria, and muscularis mucosa (in order of superficial to deep). The submucosa is the second layer of bowel wall and is divided into thirds, such that the upper third is SM1, the middle third is SM2, and the lower third is SM3. The muscularis propria is the third layer of the bowel wall, and the adventitia is the fourth layer. Unlike the remainder of the GI tract, the esophagus does not have an outer serosal layer.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) </strong>is particularly useful for low-stage esophageal cancers as they can be managed without need for esophagectomy. This is the preferred method of resection for Tis (limited to the epithelium) and T1a (has not penetrated through the muscularis mucosa into the submucosa) esophageal cancers as the risk of nodal metastasis is negligible (&lt; 2%). The operative mortality is 2% after an esophagectomy; therefore, the risk-benefit analysis is favorable for EMR in stage T1a tumors.&nbsp; <br /><br />Stage T1b tumors (infiltrates into submucosa but does not penetrate muscularis propria), as in the above patient, have a widely varying range of nodal involvement (from a few percent to up to 60%). Therefore, in order to decide on esophagectomy vs EMR for these patients, the tumor characteristics have to be examined.&nbsp; <br /><br />Good candidates for EMR for T1b tumors are those with tumors &lt; 2 cm, well to moderately differentiated tumors, lack of lymphovascular invasion around the tumor, tumor limited to SM1 level of submucosa, and no enlarged lymph nodes seen on staging imaging. <strong>Involvement of SM3 submucosa level would increase the likelihood of lymph node involvement, which would make esophagectomy in an otherwise fit surgical candidate the superior method of resection.</strong> T1b lesions that are larger, moderately to poorly differentiated, have lymphovascular invasion, or have enlarged lymph nodes on staging workup should undergo esophagectomy if otherwise fit for surgery."

There are a number of methodologies for quality improvement processes, but the most frequently used are the Lean and Six Sigma methodologies.&nbsp; <br />\n<strong>Lean focuses on waste reduction</strong> by using tools such as the value stream map, which allows each step of a process to be visualized in a flow chart along with its associated value to the stakeholder. When a step adds little value to a stakeholder, it becomes a focus for the reduction of its resource consumption. For instance, if it was discovered that one step of the preoperative process required a nurse to walk halfway across the hospital to the only printer on the floor, the quality improvement project team could focus on this step, which adds little value to the surgeon and contributes to delays.&nbsp; <br /><br />One tenet of <strong>lean process</strong> methodology is <strong>the expectation that outcomes will continue to improve with continual lean methodology</strong>. The quality improvement team revisits the process repeatedly and looks for opportunities to further fine-tune the value stream map. Rapid process improvement events are held to gather input from those most familiar with the process and brainstorm solutions.&nbsp; <br /><br />The Six Sigma process often works in conjunction with the Lean process in both manufacturing and health care settings. Six Sigma is characterized by the Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control model of improvement and&nbsp;centers around the aim to eliminate process errors. Lean Six Sigma is a quality improvement discipline that has gained popularity in the health care industry by combining the Lean and Six Sigma methodologies to obtain a synergy of both error and waste reduction."
